# SUB_TEST


These files are a combination of sudo code and test code to parameterize each function of the subsystems. 

The python has a configuration section to work with the Numato USB GPIO 16 port board, using the python serial library. This in turn, interfaces with the sainsmart relay board to drive the pnumatic valves, LED control, and other functions of the placement system.
